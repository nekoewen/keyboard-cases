# Some Random Keyboard Cases
3D printing files for a few different mechanical keyboard cases.

The [Crisco](https://github.com/ch604/crisco) is a 20-key keyboard (or macropad if you prefer) based on the Butterstick by g Heavy Industries. The case is extremely simple, and requires double-sided tape to hold the PCB in place.

The [Masonry](https://github.com/dcpedit/masonry) is a 40% keyboard with a fascinating layout. This case is the result of converting the original designer's laser cutting files into an STL. You may want to add some support to the part where the connector goes through. It calls for the same mounting hardware as the laser-cut case (i.e., seven 4mm M2 standoffs and 14 M2 screws).

The [2% Milk](https://github.com/Spaceboards/SpaceboardsHardware/tree/master/Keyboards/2%25%20Milk) is a 2-key macropad with a case shaped like a milk carton. I created a very simple friction-fitted backing for it, so you don't have to leave the MCU exposed.

The [TouhouPad v2](https://github.com/Pimentoso/TouhouPad_v2) is a simple keyboard specifically for playing Touhou bullet hell games. My version just has a wider opening to accomodate cheap USB-C Pro Micros.
